What I'd like to achieve with this app is to help thousands of ppl to overcome traumas related to AWS cost system lol

I was also the one who accidentally kept Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) working for a few weeks, resulting to sleeping on street in winter season...(kidding)

**Anyhoo, this app will get you aws cost notification from Line App.**
